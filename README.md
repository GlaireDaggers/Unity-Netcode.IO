# Unity-Netcode.IO
A lightweight plugin to allow WebGL Unity games to use Netcode.IO for UDP socket communication.

This plugin wraps around the JavaScript API for this Netcode.IO browser extension: https://github.com/RedpointGames/netcode.io-browser and exposes it to Unity in a simple and easy-to-use API.

# Usage
TODO

# Platforms
Currently only WebGL is supported. All other platforms will indicate no support when querying for Netcode.IO support.
However, hopefully in the not-too-distant future this will change, as I'm also working on a pure managed C# implementation of the Netcode.IO protocol with some promising initial results.
